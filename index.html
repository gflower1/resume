    <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
    <p>
        I currently serve as the Project Director at Mike Hooks, LLC, where I lead the Project Management, Quality Control, and Surveying departments.</p>
    <p>
        With over a decade of experience in the construction and dredging industries, my career path has been marked by a consistent drive for excellence and innovation.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to my leadership at Mike Hooks, I founded my own company, Triton Ventures, LLC, in 2014.<br/>
        Initially providing administrative services for construction projects, and expanding into website design and hosting in 2019, my broad expertise includes identifying organizational inefficiencies, mentoring project managers, and coordinating between departments to streamline processes.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am deeply committed to leveraging technology to enhance operational efficiency, which has led me to pursue web development in 2024. This new venture aims to better serve my web clients and create software solutions that support my primary role at Mike Hooks and explore other emerging opportunities. My diverse skill set and entrepreneurial spirit drive my passion for continuous improvement and innovation in all my professional endeavors.
